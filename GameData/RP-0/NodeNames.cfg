{
	@NODE[node0_start]
	{
		@title = Start
		@description = Early sounding rockets; small solid and liquid engines. 1945-1950 or so.
	}
	@NODE[node1_basicRocketry]
	{
		@title = Early Orbital Rocketry
		@description = Early kerosene/LOX and hypergolic engines, small solid kick motors. You should be able to get to orbit...just. 1950-1957.
	}
	@NODE[node2_generalRocketry]
	{
		@title = Orbital Rocketry
		@description = The first ICBMs and ton-class LVs. The first high-performance upper stages. With this you can place a capsule in orbit, or send a probe to the moon. 1958-1962
	}
	@NODE[node2_survivability]
	{
		@title = Survivability
		@description = Short of a nuclear explosion, reentry is one of the most trying environments for a material. This allows the first recoverable probes, and for the first human (uncontrolled without Stability) spaceflight missions. 1960.
	}
	@NODE[node2_stability]
	{
		@title = 3-axis Stability/Early Probes
		@description = While the first probes were spin-stabilized, 3-axis stability is necessary for a true spacecraft, whether crewed or uncrewed. This allows for RCS-stabilized flight in orbit, and for the first controllable, long-duration probes.
