Github Repo:  https://gihub.com/KSP-RO/RP-0

**Requirements:**
- Realism Overhaul and all its required mods
- Lack's SXT (although only the engines have RO configs as of yet)

**Recommended:**
- Procedural Fairings
- Procedural Parts
- Procedural Dynamics Procedural Wings
- Ven's Stock Parts Revamp (not available on the CKAN yet)

Note that only play through the first five nodes (1962 in our history, or so) is supported as of now, so parts in stock or in the above mods that should be available later are not properly placed or priced yet.
